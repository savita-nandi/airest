d0d23ede-a9d5-4bf4-bf42-4a10736332da,"Vin Nostro 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)#Really too ripely sweet and hot for comfort, even though the alcohol is only 14%. Tastes like oven-baked cherries and blackberries, with lots of caramel.",Vin Nostro 2004 Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley)
8799e434-4a5a-4fc5-856c-9b6eb216bda4,"Kalbarri 2006 Bin Select 513 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia)#Kalbarri's Cab boasts plenty of red-berry flavors and a soft, easygoing, maybe even slightly sweet, finish.",Kalbarri 2006 Bin Select 513 Cabernet Sauvignon (South Eastern Australia)
451ee65c-50dc-432f-92cd-d461b5849622,"Harveys NV Fino Light Sherry (Jerez)#â€œLightâ€ is misleading, because this really isn't a light fino at all. In fact, it's rather heavy and clunky, with a salty undercurrent to its lemon and nut flavors. Tastes more cooked than ideal.",Harveys NV Fino Light Sherry (Jerez)
55687beb-c003-40da-8db8-4a55474bb0c1,"Septima 2006 Tempranillo (Mendoza)#Rhubarb and tomato leaf are strongly present on the nose, followed by grassy flavors and a hollow, thin mouthfeel. Septima is Spanish-owned, and this 800-case bottling seems like a nod to the homeland. But it tastes anything but Spanish.",Septima 2006 Tempranillo (Mendoza)
2c9b35b2-0ac5-41d9-b552-7af89a09a44f,"Erath 2006 Pinot Noir (Oregon)#There is not much going on here. As with most California Pinots in this price range, the Erath is a stripped-down, pale and insubstantial take on the grape. Pinots may be light and still profound, but this is simply light and watery.",Erath 2006 Pinot Noir (Oregon)
f2f4992d-9aa9-4865-9ecd-aa06a9130585,"Bridgeview 2006 GewÃ¼rztraminer (Southern Oregon)#This is an odd duck for GewÃ¼rz; lacking any of the floral character generally associated with that grape. It's lemony and slightly sweet, with good acid. It makes a pleasant, if generic white wine to accompany spicy noodles or light seafood.",Bridgeview 2006 GewÃ¼rztraminer (Southern Oregon)
475cc59c-ebb7-42cb-b601-6d5a2fb33afa,"Snake River 2003 Arena Valley Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Idaho)#Earthy, spicy aromas lead, rolling into smoky layers of typical Cab flavors. Berry, tobacco and touches of sweet oak give it okay complexity.",Snake River 2003 Arena Valley Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Idaho)
dda16d76-62c6-4e50-a0f9-958ef5495cdc,"VivÃ¡c Winery 2005 V. Single Vineyard Nebbiolo (New Mexico)#A good balance of berry, spice and fruit recommend this; it has balance and structure and a degree of complexity that will lend it to pairing with heartier dishes. An interesting and fun wine.",VivÃ¡c Winery 2005 V. Single Vineyard Nebbiolo (New Mexico)
ee4edbcb-4996-4d64-99a7-650642502fdf,"Bridgeview 2006 Blue Moon Pinot Gris (Oregon)#This smells of burnt match and soap, with flavors of very tart citrus and hints of pear and orange. There's plenty of acid but not much weight to the mid-palate.",Bridgeview 2006 Blue Moon Pinot Gris (Oregon)
1a802103-cc9a-4c2c-992c-d84cbe0ee866,"Cartlidge & Browne 2005 Merlot (California)#Sharp and jammy, with blackberry and cherry flavors. It's a simple, direct wine that needs a big, juicy cheeseburger.",Cartlidge & Browne 2005 Merlot (California)
3975a67c-2673-4104-bf77-d91b15e3dbb8,"Celler La Bollidora 2005 Plan B Red (Terra Alta)#Heavily stewed and raisiny, almost to the point of no return. And while the wine is definitely cooked and starchy, it rallies on the palate and finish to show some decent Priorat-style richness and flavor. But let's face it, the wine is 80% baked and won't last for much longer.",Celler La Bollidora 2005 Plan B Red (Terra Alta)
477e13f6-3a88-4a9a-a8c6-989e3b9b7435,"Chaddsford 2005 Merlot (Pennsylvania)#The nose on this Merlot is earthy, with savory scents of mushroom, soft fruit and spice, but on the palate, the wine could use a bit more structure and presence. Overall though, it's balanced and friendly, and will pair well with myriad mild-flavored dishes.",Chaddsford 2005 Merlot (Pennsylvania)
44d566ad-6f66-4d52-8ffc-321359231e30,"Pacific Oasis 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County)#An awkward wine, high in acid, with grapefruit, green tea and dried thyme aromas and flavors. Okay in its own way, but doesn't seem quite ripe.",Pacific Oasis 2006 Sauvignon Blanc (Santa Barbara County)
4b9010cf-66e7-465b-9370-e4105c6b0197,"Shannon Ridge 2006 Grenache (Lake County)#Sharp and rustic, with medicinal, LifeSaver candy cherry flavors that finish with a scour of acidity.",Shannon Ridge 2006 Grenache (Lake County)
dc51fd3f-e4c1-4a59-8ad0-4313d895b3bc,"Norman 2003 Conquest Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)#Norman Conquest, get it? The wine itself is too soft, and lacks the tannin-acid structure needed for balance. Too bad, because the oak-infused cherry and blackberry flavors are fine.",Norman 2003 Conquest Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)
0db3cc98-9511-4581-9539-f5e46a6f9fa7,"Funky Llama 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza)#Lightly tropical, with peach, citrus and pineapple aromas. The palate offers mostly sharp citrus flavors of lime and orange, and the finish holds onto that theme.",Funky Llama 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Mendoza)
311f618d-8214-485b-88d8-d7a15739809f,"Michel Torino 2006 Coleccion Chardonnay (CalchaquÃ­ Valley)#Aromas of sweet melon and honey suggest an innocuous quality that's confirmed on the palate, where basic apple and pear flavors come across a bit sweet. Finishes with some scour and a little harshness.",Michel Torino 2006 Coleccion Chardonnay (CalchaquÃ­ Valley)
